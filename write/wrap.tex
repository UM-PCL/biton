\begin{abstract}

  As quantum computers become more fault-tolerant, the resources required for error correction continue to rapidly grow as a function of the code size and number of logical qubits in the system. In particular, the communication bandwidth between different temperatures in the quantum computer is growing at a rate that is not sustainable. We observe that we can defer and reduce communication by greedily calculating error corrections and speculatively applying them with small hardware overhead in the low-temperature layers. At the cost of accuracy and program execution time, this allows for a greater scale in terms of logical qubits and shorter quantum program execution times.
